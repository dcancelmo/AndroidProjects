I did not collaborate with anyone and all work within this submission is my own.

AsyncTask
Whichever task is clicked first will finish and then display the result and then be overwritten by the second clicked asynctask (when done) regardless of speed. It is based on order of being created.
HandlerThread
The code task executes based on which finishes first so the latter task will override the prior.

The purpose of this application is to implement asynctask and handlers to complete (small) time consuming tasks.


This app was developed for Android version 7.1.1 API 25 and texted on the Nexus 6 with 1440x2560 resolution and x86 CPU.
