ReadMe File

I did not collaborate with anyone and all work within this submission is my own.

Assignment 8.5 was to redo a previous assignment to get credit back and to prove we now understand the concepts. I am redoing Assignment 7. I corrected the issues and the user can now add courses that will be displayed and they will persist and be displayed correctly in between app launches.

This assignment was to create an app that utilized databases to store data. The user uses menus to change activities to an activity to enter data for a new course that when entered will be displayed in the recycler view of the main activity.

This app was developed for Android version 7.1.1 API 25 and tested on the Nexus 6 with 1440x2560 resolution and x86 CPU.
