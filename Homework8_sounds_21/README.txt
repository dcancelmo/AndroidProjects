I did not collaborate with anyone and all work within this submission is my own.

This assignment was to create an app that would play audio files. It must retain the fragments so that playback is not interupted. It must also make use of mater-detail interface when rotated to landscape. The app must use a custom style using custom colors and 'buttons' for each item of the recyclerview. The styles must also be different for pre and post Android API 21.

Testing was done using emulators of Nexus 6: One urinngin API 25 and the other API 19.
